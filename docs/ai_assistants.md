# The Future of AI Coding Assistants

AI coding assistants are rapidly evolving from simple autocomplete tools to autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and task execution.

## Evolution Phases

1. **Autocomplete**: Deep learning models that predict the next token.
2. **Chat-based interactions**: Models that can answer questions and explain code.
3. **Agentic Workflows**: Systems that can plan, execute tools, and iterate on solutions.

## Key Challenges

- **Ctx Length**: Understanding large codebases requires handling massive tokens.
- **Reasoning**: Going beyond pattern matching to true problem solving.
- **Reliability**: Ensuring code is correct and safe to run.

## Antigravity

Antigravity represents a new generation of assistants that integrate deep integration with the IDE and advanced planning capabilities.
